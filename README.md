# gluon-docker
Experiments to dockerize a gluon - based on openwrt docker


The output looks kind of like this:
```
âžœ  gluon-docker git:(main) docker run -p 8080:80 -p 2222:22 gluon
/etc/preinit: line 5: can't create /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload: Read-only file system
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted
Press the [f] key and hit [enter] to enter failsafe mode
Press the [1], [2], [3] or [4] key and hit [enter] to select the debug level
Failed to send flush request: Operation not permitted
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted
```
Which is normal as the container is not allowed to change kernel settings.
SSH and Web-Interface still works - but I could not configure the gluon-node properly.
When saving the settings, it said that it fails to edit `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname: Read-only filesystem`

## instructions

1. execute `build-gluon.sh`
2. run the docker container `docker run -p 8080:80 -p 2222:22 gluon`

3. `ssh -p 2222 root@localhost`
4. `uci show`
5. browser http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/config/wizard

opkg update works but it is not that useful as it is now
